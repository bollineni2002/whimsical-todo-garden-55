# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

After pushing the changes to your GitHub repository, follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your GitHub repository at https://github.com/bollineni2002/whimsical-todo-garden-55
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment" section:
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - This will automatically use the workflow file we've created

The deployment process will start automatically after you push the changes to the main branch. Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at:

https://bollineni2002.github.io/whimsical-todo-garden-55/

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Check the GitHub Actions tab in your repository to see if there are any errors in the workflow
2. Make sure the repository is public or you have GitHub Pages enabled for private repositories
3. Verify that the workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) exists in your repository
4. Check that the base path in vite.config.ts matches your repository name

## Local Testing

To test the build locally before pushing:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will create a production build and serve it locally for testing.
